## About Me

I am a Master's student at the University of Trieste, currently on track to get my degree in _Advanced Mathematics_ by March, 2025 with the top grade. I have a profound passion for discovery and abstraction in Mathematics, mainly in algebraic geomtry and computational algebra. Please feel free to contact me for any position in this or adjacent fields. I visited Berlin in August and fell in love with the city, so being close to it is a bonus.
## Research Interests

- **Computational Algebra:** I was exposed to this field last year thorough an introductory course on Groebner basis and their applications. Currently, in my Master's thesis work I am delving into the combinatorial aspects of _Graph rigidity_, focusing on the recent proof of  
- **Algebraic Geometry:** 

## News

- **[May. 2025]** My first preprint on arXiv!
