## About Me

I am a Master's student at the University of Trieste, on track to graduate in July, 2025 and with a very successful academic record. I have long had a deep fascination with algebra and geometry, and through many courses at the University and at SISSA I had the opportunity to learn about algebraic geometry and computational algebra. In November, 2024 I participated in the "Macaulay2 in the Sciences" workshop at MPI MIS in Leipzig where I learned about the many and widely different applications of these fields, and together with that group we have published a package for research in signature varieties. My most recent courses have taken me into a journey in scheme theory and derived functors. I am currently looking for a PhD position, feel free to contact me to discuss this further!
