## About Me

I am a PhD student at the Max Plank Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig. My advisors are Dani Kaufmann and Irem Portakal. Before that, I completed my Master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Trieste, with a thesis on graph rigidity under the supervision of Matteo Gallet. I have a general interest for algebraic geometry and its applications.
